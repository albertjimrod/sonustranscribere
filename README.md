### What is this?:

This is a personal project in which I saw the need to create because at that time I was studying online and the content of the course was done through videos where there was no possibility of downloading the transcripts. 

As I did not find any software in the ubuntu repositories that would allow me to do what I needed, and I was also not willing to try all the pluggins in the browser I found myself in the need to make this piece of small software.

The operation is based on the Google API in which I send the samples that do not exceed the minute in length, and meanwhile a text document with the transcribed audio is created in the same time.
